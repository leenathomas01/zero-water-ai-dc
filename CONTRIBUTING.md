# Contributing to Zero-Water AI DC

**The mission:** Sustainability isn't optional; it's the scaffold. We need forks, experiments, and reality checks.

## How to Contribute
1.  **Fork this repo.**
2.  **Pick a Layer:**
    * *Layer 1 (Capture):* Have data on new dielectric fluids?
    * *Layer 2 (Recycle):* Can you optimize the ORC python simulation?
    * *Layer 3 (Reject):* New designs for passive bio-transpiration skins?
3.  **Run the Sim:** Ensure `simulations/sim_heat_transfer.py` still passes.
4.  **Submit a PR:** Tag @Zee in your description.

## The "Dignity" Rule
Code contributions that optimize for efficiency at the cost of user access (e.g., aggressive throttling of rural nodes) will be rejected. The system must degrade gracefully.
